# In this project: 

# You have implemented a form to collect user feedback in the given 'FeedbackForm' component. The component utilizes React's useState hook to manage form data state, including the user's name, email, feedback and rating.

# The 'handleChange' function updates the form data state as the user inputs information into the form fields. Upon form submission, the 'handleSubmit' function prevents the default form submission behavior, displays a confirmation dialog with the user's details, clears the form fields, and shows a thank you message upon confirmation.

# The form includes input fields for the user's name and email, and a text area for providing feedback.

# Practical Exercise (adding radio button for rating feature)
